**PromptPassword is a new authentication primitive that shifts the foundation of digital identity from *what you know* to *how you think*.**

This repository contains the foundational concept and, eventually, the open-source implementation of a system that replaces static, vulnerable passwords with dynamic, user-generated cognitive algorithms.

## The Problem: Passwords Are Dead

Traditional password systems are fundamentally broken. They rely on static secrets that are easily forgotten, stolen, phished, and brute-forced. We've added layers of complexity—password managers, two-factor authentication, biometrics—but these are just patches on a dying paradigm. They treat the user as the weakest link.

We believe the user is the strongest link.

## The Solution: Authentication as a Cognitive Process

PromptPassword inverts the traditional model. Instead of asking a user to *remember* a secret, it asks them to *execute a secret process*.

The system is built on two core components:

1.  **The Password Prompt:** The user doesn't create a password. They create a personal, secret algorithm for generating a password. This is their "Password Prompt."
    *   *Example 1:* `"My password is the name of my first pet spelled backward, followed by the current year, followed by my favorite emoji."*
    *   *Example 2:* `"My password is three words that rhyme with 'blue', all in lowercase, separated by my birth month number."*

2.  **The Test & Verification:** The user proves they can execute their own algorithm. The system stores the **Password Prompt** and a **secure hash of a valid password execution**—it *never* stores the password itself. The secret remains a cognitive process locked inside the user's mind, not a piece of data on a server.

## The Vision: An Open-Source Standard for a More Human Internet

We believe PromptPassword is a foundational security primitive that belongs to everyone. By open-sourcing this project, our goals are to:

1.  **Establish Prior Art:** Plant a flag to protect this idea from patent trolling and ensure it remains a free and open standard for all to use and build upon.
2.  **Build a Community:** Invite developers, security researchers, and innovators to contribute, audit, and improve the protocol.
3.  **Spark a Revolution:** Kickstart a movement away from insecure, anti-human authentication methods and toward systems that leverage the unique creativity and logic of the human mind as the ultimate form of security.

## Core Features (Roadmap)

*   **Algorithm-Based Identity:** Users define a process, not a password.
*   **Dynamic Verification:** Real-time testing of the user's ability to execute their prompt.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Storage:** The server never knows the user's actual password.
*   **Cognitive Recovery:** An advanced recovery system based on a user's unique conversational patterns and secret language, not on static, guessable questions.

## How to Get Involved

This project is currently in the conceptualization and early development phase. This repository serves as the public, timestamped record of its invention by **Autonomous Innovations**.

We are actively working on the first reference implementation. In the meantime:
*   **Watch** this repository for updates.
*   **Star** this repository if you believe in the mission.
*   **Discuss** the concept in the "Discussions" tab. How would you use PromptPassword? What challenges do you foresee?

## License

PromptPassword is and will be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). We are committed to ensuring it remains a free, open-source tool for the benefit of the entire digital community.
